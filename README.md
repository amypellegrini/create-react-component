# Create React Component

Inspired by Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

`create-react-component` is intended to be a React component boilerplate/bootstrapper utility which exposes a simple CLI to bootstrap a React component template, and it is designed to speed up the process of creating a component by assuming some reasonable standards and defaults based on popular usage.

This is just in its Alpha stage and I'm currently working alone, so don't rush! Or help me to make this faster with your contributions.
