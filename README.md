# Create React Component

Inspired by Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

React component boilerplate/bootstrapper utility is intended to speed up the process of creating a component, by assuming some reasonable standards and defaults based on popular usage.

This is just in its Alpha stage and I'm currently working alone, so don't rush! Or help me to make this faster with your contributions.
